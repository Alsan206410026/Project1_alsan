# Nepal's Tea Trading - E-commerce Website

## 🌟 Project Overview

This is a web-based e-commerce platform dedicated to showcasing and selling premium Nepali tea and traditional products. The website represents the rich tea heritage of Nepal, particularly from the Ilam region, and provides a modern digital platform for traditional businesses to reach global customers.

## 🎯 Why I Chose This Project

I chose tea as my project theme because it is an important part of Nepal. Ilam makes some of the best tea in the world, just like Darjeeling. Our tea shows the beauty of our mountains, our land, and the hard work of our farmers.

This website is my effort to bring Nepali products online. It shows how traditional businesses can use technology to reach customers around the world. With e-commerce, small farmers can sell directly and get fair prices.

This project is about keeping our heritage alive while using new ideas for a better future.
